This file contains the general workflow as of 04/2024 for the PHAST pipeline (for range data)

1. Construct a range dataset for the clade of interest, for California

2. Construct range datasets for each individual ecoregion (as in step 1, but more granular)

3. Run the main.R script to: 

  1. Generate a phylogenetic tree for California and all ecoregions
  2. List missing taxa from phylognetic tree, present taxa etc 
  3. Generate cophenetic matrix for California and all ecoregions

3. Run Hoffman_parallel_.._R and Submit_Hoffman_parallel...._.sh on Hoffman2 cluster for california using
  1. The phylogenetic tree for either california or corresponding ecoregions 
  2. the cophenetic matrix for california or corresponding ecoregions. 

4. Retrieve output manually and run the Data_compilation-Method2.ipynb script for each corresponding joblog for California and ecoregions. 

5. Run the main_surface script to construct JSON files of parameters for each null model for California etc. 

6. Run the main_hexpop script: generates an SF object with each hexagon of california assigned a PD, mpd, mntd, and various significance values. 

7. Run the main_reserves script: does a similar thing as hexpop, but just examining reserve systems.
